# LSTM for Production
In this repo, we will use the production data of [Equinorâ€™s Volve data set](https://www.equinor.com/energy/volve-data-sharing), a publicly available subsurface data set, to predict oil, gas, and water production.

In the `LSTM_for_Production_Univariate`, we will train three separate models for oil, gas, and water prediction.  
In the `LSTM_for_Production_Multivariate`, we will train one model to predict three outputs (oil, gas, and water).
